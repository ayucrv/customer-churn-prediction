# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on behavioral and demographic data. The primary objective is to identify customers who are at risk of leaving a service, enabling businesses to take proactive measures for retention.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives
- Analyze customer data to identify patterns related to churn
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for churn prediction
- Provide insights into key factors contributing to churn

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description
The dataset includes anonymized information about customers, including:
- Demographic data (e.g., age, gender, senior citizen status)
- Subscription details (e.g., services used, contract type, tenure)
- Financial attributes (e.g., charges, payment methods)
- Churn status (target variable)

*Source: Publicly available dataset*

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Processing:** pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
- **Modeling:** scikit-learn, XGBoost

## ðŸ§ª Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling and transformation

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of features
   - Correlation analysis
   - Churn patterns and trends

3. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision


## ðŸ“ˆ Results & Observations
- The models identified multiple patterns related to customer churn.
- Shorter tenure, monthly contracts, and limited services were strong churn indicators.
- XGBoost delivered the best performance across evaluation metrics.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways
This project demonstrates the practical application of classification models to predict customer behavior. It showcases end-to-end steps including data preprocessing, analysis, and supervised machine learning.
